I am a Master student at [NEU](http://www.neu.edu.cn), and my research is on 3D Reconstruction with Machine Learning and Computer Graphics techniques. I am currently supervised by Professor [Rongfei Zeng](https://wingfeitsang.github.io/home/). I got my bachelor's degree in the [Software College of Northeastern University](http://sc.neu.edu.cn).
